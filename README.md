### Hi, I'm Billy 👋

I spent 12 years of my life living in a diving chamber all over the planet. I'm a recent graduate of LightHouse Labs and am actively trying to get out of the water and into the world of web development.

- 📱 I’m currently working for [Attune Fitness](https://attune.app/) & [Big Boy Marketing](https://bigboy.ca/)
- 💻 One of the best parts of web dev is not having to write on pen and paper... as a lefty (if you know you know)
- 🤓 I’m currently fine tuning my skills creating RailTrack.App
- 📫  How to reach me: billy_mckinnon@hotmail.com
- 🤡 Fun fact: I am DEATHLY afraid of heights
