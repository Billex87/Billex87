### Hi, I'm Billy 👋

I spent 12 years of my life living in diving chamber all over the planet. I'm a recent graduate of LightHouse Labs and am actively trying to get out of the water and into the world of web development.

- 📱 I’m currently working on my portfolio webpage & an app for CN Rail
- 💻 One of the best parts of web dev is not having to write on pen and paper... as a lefty (if you know you know)
- 🤓 I’m currently fine tuning my skills with FreeCodeCamp
- 📫  How to reach me: billy_mckinnon@hotmail.com
- 🚴🏽‍♀️  Fun fact: Even though I've spent months flying to work, I am DEATHLY afraid of heights
